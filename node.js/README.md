# Simple User Creation and Login

Here's a scaffold for creating a user in a Node.js application using Express. This example demonstrates how to set up a simple route for user registration, including receiving user details from a form submission and storing them. For simplicity, this example uses an in-memory object to store user information, but in a real application, you should integrate a database to persist user data.

This code provides a basic framework. For security, always hash passwords before storing them, and consider implementing additional features like email verification, CAPTCHA to prevent automated sign-ups, and using a database for storing user information.
