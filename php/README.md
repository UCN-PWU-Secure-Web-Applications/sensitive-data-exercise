# Simple User Creation and Login

Here's how to adapt the server code for user creation and login to PHP, assuming a simple approach with file-based storage for demonstration. For any real application, use a database and hash passwords securely.

## Notes

**Security**: This example uses plain text for simplicity. Always hash passwords using password_hash() and verify with password_verify() in real applications.

**Storage**: This example uses a file (users.json) for storage. In practice, utilize a database for storing user data securely and efficiently.

This PHP code provides a basic framework for handling user creation and login, demonstrating the process in a PHP environment. Remember to enhance security and functionality for real-world applications.
